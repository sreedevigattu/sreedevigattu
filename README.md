| This story tries to answer the questions - **Where does the plastic in our oceans come from?**, Which countries are the major offenders? How to tackle plastic pollution problem?  | The **Gramener Data Comicgen** challenge was to analyse the data provided and present the results using the comic characters (using Gramaner's API). The data was responses to a survey on What does humanity worry about? What do people in different regions of the world perceive as risks? What are people's experiences of risks? My story is built around Afghanistan and its neighbouring country Uzbekistan.
