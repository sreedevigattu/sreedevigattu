### 1 Machine Learning 

#### 1.1 Projects
Note: _Cannot share Code from the projects due to NDA_
| Date | Project | Details| 
|---|---|---|
| Feb - Oct 2022 | **MP excise Data Analysis** @ IIMB | The MP excise team auctions the liquor shops in the state every year. Instead of deciding the auction price ad hoc, they want to move towards an evidence based price using machine learning techniques. The liquor consumption and census data of the past years for various districts & shop level data was used for the analysis. Clustering and Logistic Regression techniques were used on this data to build models to help the MP excise team with the pricing of liquor shops. Used python, scikit learn, pandas|
| May-April2022 | **PGDS course - upGrad & IIITB** | [Credit Risk EDA](https://github.com/sreedevigattu/crediteda), [Online course lead scoring](https://github.com/sreedevigattu/leadscoring), [House Price Prediction](https://github.com/sreedevigattu/housepricing), [Recommendation Systems](https://github.com/sreedevigattu/pgds/tree/master/Recommendattion%20Systems)|
| Dec-May 2021 | **Malicious Command Detection** @ConnectWise | Classify (powershell) commands as malicious using NLP based ML techniques. Used: python, NLP libraries (nltk, spacy), pandas, scikit learn|
| Nov - Dec 2019 | **Email analysis** @ MCA Technology| Analysed emails to detect mails that could indicate fraud using various text analytics methods like topic modelling (lda), word embedding and network analysis (using gephi). Developed tools using python, pandas, gephi, genism. |
| Mar - Nov 2019 | **Sensitive Data Discovery** @ Netalytics | Developed an implementation idea (Logistic Regression model) to identify if a machine contains files with sensitive data using Machine Learning techniques (text mining, neural networks). Used: Elastic Search, python, NLP libraries (nltk, spacy), pandas, scikit learn, keras. |

#### 1.2 Challenges
| Date | Project | Details| 
|---|---|---|
| Jan-Feb 2021 | **[WiDS Datathon 2021](https://github.com/sreedevigattu/wids2021)** | The WiDS Datathon 2021 focuses on patient health, with an emphasis on the chronic condition of diabetes, through data from MITâ€™s GOSSIS (Global Open Source Severity of Illness Score) initiative. Built a XGBoost based Logistic Regression model to determine whether a patient admitted to an ICU has been diagnosed with a particular type of diabetes, Diabetes Mellitus.

### 2 My journey in Data Storytelling
#### 2.1 Projects
Note: _Cannot share Code and visualisations from the projects due to NDA_
| Date | Project | Details |
|---|---|---|
| Dec 2021 - Nov 2022 | **Crop Residue Management** @ IIMB | CII runs an initiative on Crop Residue Management (CRM) aims to promote the adoption of alternate and sustainable straw management and agricultural practices with an aim to eradicate the conventional practices of open crop residue burning that leads to air pollution in the NCR. CII ran surveys of the initiative for the years 2018, 2019 and 2020. Exploratory data analysis of this data was done, insights were drawn, a data story was built using Tableau explaining the insights and presented to the CII. A case and teaching note was prepared on this analysis. |

The user data from mongodb is (custom) synchronised to the Google's Big Query using Google's Serverless components - Cloud Function, Cloud Run & Scheduler. Meaningful insights (from the YogiFi App and mat data) were identified and presented in a Google Data Studio to the customers (buyers/ decision makers)|
| Sep2019-Jan2020 | **[Yogifi's Operational Analytics in Chatio]()** *To add link*| [Yogifi](https://yogifi.fit/) is an Interactive Fitness Mat that provides guided instructions and real-time corrections on your form/poses, for yoga and other workouts. Meaningful insights (from the YogiFi App and mat data) were identified and presented in a dashboard to the customers (buyers/ decision makers). Used chartio (+stitch) to present the data fetched from mongoDB. Used in CES 2020. |

The data was responses to a survey on  Worries and Risks, What does humanity worry about? What do people in different regions of the world perceive as risks? What are people's experiences of risks? My story is built around Afghanistan and its neighbouring country Uzbekistan. [1st runner up](https://github.com/sreedevigattu/just-a-store/blob/main/Data%20Comicgen%20Awards%20-%202021%20-%201st%20Runner%20up.pdf)|
